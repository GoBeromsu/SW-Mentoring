# Boolean Algebra 
- Boolean Algebra, also known as logical function, is a method which distinguishes whether the proposition is true or not.
  
## Algebraic manipulation
### Postulates and Theorems of Boolean algebra.
    - Through these equations you may easily simplify the complex boolean algebra.

## Logic circuits
    - Method that describes the boolean algebra by an image. It may be used as an idea of designing electronic system and also another expression of numeral equations visualized to the picture.
    - There are multiple gates that lines are passing through, and each gate has their own job doing on calculation. For example 'AND' gates work as a logical multipication, and 'OR' gates work as a logical addification. But as a matter of fact, in real electronic circuits, only 'NAND' gate and 'NOR' gate is used.

## Three binary variables
### minterms and maxterms
    - Minterm presented as SOP(sum of products) form
      - ex) ab + cd
    - Maxterm presented as POS(product of sums) form
      - ex) (a+b)(c+d)

### defying functions
    - All functions consisted of variables can be defined by minterms and maxterms.
    - From the explanation of my professor, minterm designates the spot of 1, and maxterm is about where the 0 is.
### relation between minterms and maxterms
    - They are complementary to each other.
    - Same meaning as (m1)' = M1.
- Demorgan's Law
